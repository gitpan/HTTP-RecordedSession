Installation is quite straight-forward.  Simply:

1. move HTTP-RecordedSession-0.04.tar.gz to your sources directory.  For example:

mv HTTP-RecordedSession-0.04.tar.gz /usr/local/src/

2. uncompress and untar the package.  For example:

tar zxvfp HTTP-RecordedSession-0.04.tar.gz

3. cd to HTTP-RecordedSession-0.04/

4. perl Makefile.PL

5. make

6. make test

7. make install

Once the package is successfully installed, see perldoc HTTP::RecordedSession 
for usage instructions and sample scripts.
